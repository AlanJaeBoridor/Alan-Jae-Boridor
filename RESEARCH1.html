    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <div class="a">
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Republic Act No. 11203, commonly referred to as the Rice Tariffication Law of 2019, sought to reduce the price of rice and alleviate scarcity in the Philippines. Inquiries were generated regarding its impact on poverty, namely on local rice growers' income and rice prices. This study looks at how effective the law is in reducing poverty among local rice farmers, as well as how it affects rice price stability and scarcity. A mixed-methods approach is used, combining quantitative data from government publications and international organizations with qualitative insights from a literature study. Quantitative data on poverty rates, rice prices, production, imports, and consumption were examined, as well as qualitative theme analyses from the literature. The investigation indicated that, while the law initially stabilized rice prices, variables like as the COVID-19 pandemic and war between Russia and Ukraine caused price hikes. Local farmers' revenues have not increased considerably, but poverty rates have climbed. The recommendations includes examining implementation techniques, improving rice import monitoring and regulation, increasing agricultural diversification, investing in rural development, and expanding farmer social protection programs. These strategies seek to enhance the law's efficacy in decreasing poverty and correcting economic imbalances among local farmers in the Philippines.</p></div>

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <div class="a">
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Philippines, rice is the primary source of sustenance for the majority of the population. One's meal is incomplete without rice; whereas pork may be substituted with chicken or fish, rice cannot be substituted. However, the country has struggled with food scarcity particularly in rice. Factors such as climate, land conversion and farming practices are the key aspects for these problems. Despite government efforts to address the problem, the country's rice scarcity has been a cause of concern for administrations for several decades. In this period, the National Food Authority (NFA) was the only agency authorized to import rice, making sure that local farmers could sell their produced crop without getting beaten by cheaper imported rice in the market.</p></div>

 <div class="a">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines became a member of World Trade Organization in 1995, and consented to abide to its regulations, incorporating the policy on quantitative import limitations excluding rice until 2017. In 2019, the country approved Republic Act No. 11203, or the Rice Tariffication Law of 2019, which replaced the importation prohibition with tariff fees. This initiative was in line with the goal of promoting trade liberalization and creating a transparent and competitive economic environment. It was aimed to stimulate market competition, improve the quality of rice available to consumers, and reduce rice prices in the Philippines. </p></div>

 <div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Even before it was enacted in 2019, the law sparked a nation-wide discussion. Proponents argued that this would solve the rice insecurity in the country and reduce malnutrition, which is a long-standing issue in the Philippines. Critics on the other hand, asserted that it would negatively impact local rice growers, who will struggle to compete with cheaper rice that is available internationally. It also raises concerns regarding whether lower rice prices would be more beneficial than detrimental to the country’s rice output and local farmers’ sources of income.  </p></div>


 <div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">RTL aimed to stabilize rice prices and reduce rice scarcity in the country. However, there have been questions regarding its influence on poverty reduction, especially on local farmers’ income and rice price levels. As a result, this study seeks to address these concerns by looking into several key subjects. First, it seeks to establish whether the price of rice have reduced since the Rice Tariff Law was implemented. Second, it aims to assess the efficiency of the law in solving rice scarcity in the country. Additionally, the study intends to evaluate the influence of unrestricted rice imports on poverty rate of the Philippines. Lastly, it will investigate whether there is an increase on the income of local rice farmers a result of the law.</p></div>

 <h2 style="text-align: left;">LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
 <h3 style="text-align: left;">Overview of Philippine Economy</h3>

 <div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines stood out in East Asia as well as in the Pacific region for its thriving economy, which is carried by factors such urbanization, a growing middle class and a huge, youthful population. This prosperity is driven by strong consumer demand, a booming labor market, and considerable remittance inflows. According to macrotrends.net, the Philippines' GDP increased by 2.59% in 2022, reaching $404.28 billion. In 2021, the GDP was $394.09 billion, up 8.94% from 2020. However, GDP in 2020 was $361.75 billion, down 4% from 2019. Despite the slump, GDP in 2019 was $376.82 billion, representing an 8.64% growth over 2018.</p></div>

 <div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines is primarily an agricultural country, with a significant majority of the people living in rural areas and supporting themselves via agricultural livelihood. According to Philippine Statistics Authority, crop production in 2023, which was valued at 240.83 billion Php, grew by 1.2 percent at constant 2018 prices. It accounted for 56.3% of overall agricultural and fisheries output value. The value of palay climbed by 1.1% while corn decreased by 0.8%.</p></div>

 <div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the booming economy of the country, the country is still among the poorest countries in the world. According to the PSA in 2021 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), the country's poverty rate is 18.1%, with around.99 million Filipinos lives below the poverty line of PhP 12,030 per month. The rate of subsidence poverty, which indicates individuals unable to meet basic food demands, increased to 5.9%. Families were classified as poor at 13.2% (about 3.50 million), with a subsistence incidence of 3.9% or around 1.04 million families living in food poverty. </p></div>

 <h3 style="text-align: left;">Rice Shortage in the Philippines</h3>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">In recent decades, every administration has prioritized establishing food self-sufficiency in the Philippines. Political officials and the agriculture bureaucracy have highlighted the need of locally producing rice, the country's main grain, in order to fulfill the rising population's rice needs (Balisacan,. Et. Al. 2003). Despite its focus on self-sufficiency, the Philippines continues to encounter obstacles in ensuring food security, notably with rice.  As part of its commitment to serving the Filipino populace, the government has implemented measures to ensure access to food particularly rice, in the form of importation.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Importation is not new in the Philippines; the same situation happened in the 1930s, 1970s, and in the middle of the 1990s, caused by natural disasters, mismanagement, and corruption (Mendoza, 2008). The rice crisis of the 1930s was caused by a blend of reasons. Reduced rice imports were a crucial reason, pushed by the political influence of landlords who wanted higher prices. Furthermore, crop failure occurred during this time, worsening the problem (Chiba, 2010). Another rice crisis occurred in the 1970s, similar to earlier ones, and was caused by rising retail rice prices. The cause of this crisis are; the typhoon Yoling which hit the central Luzon in the middle of harvest; the peace and order in southern part of the country; and the Tungro virus disease which has affected the crops of both 1970 and 1971 (Mangahas, 1972). Natural calamities hit the country in 1995 and a rice crisis took an impact on the Ramos administration, creating an increased in inflation (Hernandez, 1996).</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">As of today, despite government attempts to increase rice production and distribution, rice scarcity remains as one of the major concerns of the country. According to a report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Philippines is predicted to remain as the largest importer of rice in 2024. Local rice prices have risen to their greatest level in 14 years, impacting this estimate. The USDA's Economic Research Service predicts that the Philippines would import over 3.8 million metric tons of rice in 2024. This projection follows a report from the Bureau of Plant Industry, which said that the country imported 3.22 million metric tons between January 1 and December 22, 2023. </p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Rice is an integral part of Filipino lives, a meal cannot be complete without rice. According to the Statista, in 2024, the average Filipino consumes about 226.9 kilos (kg). This is equivalent to consuming 0.622 kg or 622 grams of milled rice every day. With a population of 118.7 million people in 2024, the Philippines' total annual consumption would be approximately 26,638,534.4 metric tons. The Philippines produced 20.06 million metric tons of milled rice in 2023. This production is sufficient for only 77% of the population.  </p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The key issue is the Philippines' continuous rice scarcity, despite the country's agricultural richness, which includes vast rice producing regions.  One key factor on rice scarcity in the country is that the Philippines is one of countries with the greatest population growth, leading to increased demand for rice. Another key factor in the rice scarcity in the Philippines, is because of land conversion. Instead of boosting domestic rice production, the government rely on imported rice (Palatino, 2008). Because rice is farmed on tiny family operated farms that typically range in size from less than 0.5 to 4.0 hectares, the ratio is low and there is almost no room for expansion (Tibao, 2009). In highly urbanized areas, there is an obvious change in land use from agricultural to non-agricultural purposes due to the growing population (Pia, 2021). Because agricultural output in developing countries must rise to meet the need for food, there are concerns that this will pose environmental hazards in the future. The growing demand for profitable land and deterioration of the current agricultural land base might put more starin on the available agricultural land (Estacio, D., et al. 2021). According to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), a total of 46,339.38 hectares of agricultural land from 1988 until 2022 was authorized for non- agricultural uses. This constant land conversion threatens rice production, which is a major source of food security in the country.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Climate change is another factor in the rice shortage in the country, according to National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), recent natural catastrophes seriously damaged crops and livestock which led to a substantial loss in agricultural output. Climate change exacerbates both the food and economic conditions of the Filipino people. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the damages incurred due to extreme natural calamities amounted to 290 billion pesos in 2010–2019.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, rice smuggling worsened the rice problem.  Given the potential for rice crises to occur in the Philippines, the government established the National Food Authority (NFA) to address such challenges. This agency is mandated to guarantee the food security of the country by maintaining the supply and price of mainly rice (Caballero-Anthony, M., et al. 2016). The NFA, which was founded in 1972 by Presidential Decree No. 4, was given exclusive authority to import rice into the country (Dela Cruz, et al. 2019). The government's importation of rice exclusivity, managed by the NFA aims to control rice prices and provide a regular supply in the market. This unified technique helps to reduced unexpected price fluctuations and shortages that may arise from diverse importers. Furthermore, the NFA’s authority over rice imports is intended to protect and encourage local farmers by controlling the flow of cheaper imported rice, which may lower local prices and farmers' income. In accordance with the government's objective of reducing NFA’s rice importation monopoly, the NFA enabled private merchants to import rice, subjected to the issue of import permits. It also capped the amount of rice that could be imported. However, rice dealers work with politicians and agricultural authorities to stockpile supply. This supply creates a fake rice crisis and raises the price of rice (Palatino, 2008).</p></div>

 <h3 style="text-align: left;">The World Trade Organization and the Philippines </h3>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that creates and enforces trade laws between countries. Its objective is to enable producers, exporters, and importers to do business by providing a stable and transparent framework. The organization was founded in 1995 replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Anderson (1998) identifies six primary goals of the WTO: establishing and upholding international trade policy, facilitating negotiations for trade liberalization, settling trade disputes, increasing the transparency of decision-making, collaborating with other major global economic organizations, and assisting developing countries in fully utilizing the global trading system.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;"> The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established with the original membership comprising all General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) contracting parties as of January 1, 1995, and the European Community (EC). WTO accession is a complex and lengthy procedure. Only after negotiating conditions of admission, which need to be accepted by two-thirds majority of WTO members, can new member join the WTO. In actuality, accession is accomplished by getting the approval of every member (Matsushita, et al, M. 2015).</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines has been a part of WTO since the start of 1995. A spot in WTO is additional fuel for the government’s long term attempts to strengthen trade and industrial structure and performance by creating profitable new prospects in new and enlarged markets for diverse local products (Habito et al., 2003). Based to the Department of Trade and Industry, the Philippines claims that the WTO, due to its multilateral nature, provides the most opportunities for stronger alternatives to address trade issues while taking into account capacity constraints caused by differences in economic development among its members. The Philippine’ participation in WTO aimed to establish an effective price intervention and public spending policy framework for the country’s agricultural sector (Aballe, A. M. W., et al. 2019).</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">As part of its WTO membership, the Philippines committed to a number of accords governing trade in products, services, and associated activities. These accords address a wide variety of issues, including agriculture, customs valuation, tariff restructuring, dumping, countervailing measures, security measures, regulations, and intellectual property protection. </p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The Philippines imposed quantitative limitations on rice imports until 2005 in the appendix to the WTO agreement on agriculture. The result of this was the enactment of RA 8178. Under this law, agricultural products apart from rice are subject to quota rates, which are lower duty rates for minimum access volume. RA 8178 mandates the NFA to create guidelines controlling rice importation in order to safeguard local farmers. The NFA will determine the amount to be imported based on the current state of the supply as well as the suggestions of an intergovernmental committee. NFA will distribute rice via cooperatives and other distribution methods to guarantee a steady supply of the grain across the Philippines (Aballe, A. M. W., et al. 2019). The Quantitative Restriction exemption was extended until 2012, and then again until June 30, 2017. To ensure full compliance with our international commitments, it is necessary to align our domestic legislation with the relevant international agreements. Hence, the Republic Act No. 11203 was enacted. </p></div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Rice Tariffication Law </h3>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Republic Act No. 11203, widely referred to as the Rice Tariffication Law, was signed into law on February 14, 2019. This law removed quantitative restrictions on rice imports, thereby removing the NFA’s regulatory and monitoring duties, with the exception of acquiring and keeping track of an emergency buffer supplies. The law also imposed tariffs at various rates: 35% for imports from ASEAN nations, 40% for non-ASEAN countries (imports less than 350,000 tons), and a minimum of 180 percent for non-ASEAN countries (imports greater than 350,000 tonnes). The sole remaining legal non-tariff barrier to rice imports is compliance with sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), which are published by the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Plant Industry (Tobias, 2019).  Additionally, the bill keeps RA 8800’s special protection clause intact, giving the DA the authority to request further short term tariff protection for rice. It also requires the DA to spearhead an interagency effort to create a Rice Industry Roadmap for reorganizing support services in the rice industry and allot at least 10 billion pesos a year for a rice fund (Briones, 2019).</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">One important aspect is that consumers may gain from the reform as it could lead to potentially lower rice prices, thanks to increased competition from imported rice. However, consumers are also burdened with a 35% import tariff, which generates revenue allocated to the Rice Competitive Enhancement Fund (Clarete, 2019). Furthermore, this policy encouraged rice dealers and importers to maximize profits by leveraging its efficient functioning with minimum government involvement. This occurred at the price of Filipino farmers and consumers, who experienced higher inflation as a result of the pandemic (Guevarra, 2023). Thus, the RTL will harm Filipino farmers by increasing cheap rice imports, further impoverishing them.</p></div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Rice Competitive Enhancement Fund (RCEF) </h3>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The government established the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund under RA 11203 I order to upgrade rice fields and further the government’s objective of raising rice yield. This fund, which totals 10 billion per year plus any additional earnings from rice tariff collections, aims to help farmers, farmworkers, and their dependents registered in the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA), as well as DA-accredited rice cooperatives and organizations. Over the next six years, the sum will be allocated as follows: 3 billion will go toward PhilRice’s development, propagation, and promotion of rice seeds; 1 billion will go toward rice credit assistance; 5 billion will go toward rice farm mechanization, including machinery and equipment for qualified farmers, cooperatives, and local governments. Any extra money made through import taxes will be allocated toward individual rice titling and financial support for rice producers (Tobias, 2019).</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1 shows the prices of well milled and regular milled rice in the Philippines 2003-2023. The implementation of RTL in 2019 likely helped to stabilize and lower rice prices in the Philippines. Prior to the law, prices were more unstable, whereas post-law, prices appeared to have steadied. Nonetheless, the statistics show that the price per kilogram of rice in Philippine pesos appears to lower in the 2019- 2020 and significantly increased 2021-2023.</p></div>

 <h2 style="text-align: left;">METHODOLOGY</h2>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Rice Tariffication Law in reducing poverty, particularly among local rice producers. It will also assess its impact on rice price stability and its efficiency in solving the Philippines' rice deficit.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;"> The study will utilize a mixed-method approach, incorporating quantitative data obtained from government documents and other international agencies, with qualitative insights gathered from a comprehensive literature analysis. This method will provide a comprehensive analysis on the effectiveness of the Rice Tariffication Law in resolving rice scarcity and reducing poverty in the country.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Quantitative data has been acquired from a variety of governmental and international sources, including the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), and other relevant organization, in order to examine changes in poverty rates among local rice farmers before and after the law went into effect. This date additionally includes information on rice prices and stability, which was utilized to investigate how the RTL influences pricing trends. In addition, data on rice prices production, imports, and consumption was gathered to determine the law’s effectiveness in eliminating rice scarcity. To gain qualitative insights, a thorough literature review was done, which included research and publications from international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank and other relevant studies and articles.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The data was thoroughly analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The data was evaluated qualitatively using a thematic literature review to analyze trends and key subjects related to RTL’s impact on poverty reduction in the country. Quantitative tools, including graphical analysis, were used to compare and analyze rice prices, poverty rates, and rice supplies before and after the law's adoption.</p></div>

 <h2 style="text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Republic Act No. 11203, commonly referred to as the Rice Tariffication Law of 2019, was implemented with the aim of stabilizing rice prices in the country. By replacing quantitative restrictions on rice importation thereby allowing for a more open and competitive rice market. However, despite stabilizing the price of rice in the first few years of its enactment, the price of rice significantly increased during 2021 to present.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">However, it cannot be asserted that the law is ineffective, as there are diverse reasons behind the increase in rice prices in the market.  On January 30, 2020, the Philippines reported its first case of COVID-19. In response to the growing cases of covid-19, the government put the country in lockdown. This impacted the Philippines' rice supply chain in numerous ways. Movement restrictions and quarantine measures prevented the movement of rice from farmers to markets, resulting in limited availability. Labor shortages in agriculture, particularly rice growing, further hampered productivity. Delays in importation and frantic buying further stressed the supply system. These factors are attributed in the prices of rice in the country. Furthermore, the war between Russia and Ukraine that happened recently had an indirect effect on inflation in the Philippines. The conflict raised global commodity prices, notably for oil and food items, due to supply chain interruptions and fears about impending supply shortages. Increasing global prices worsened inflationary pressures in the Philippines, which imports a significant portion of its food supplies.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The RTL seeks to ease the rice shortage in the Philippines. The Philippine Statistics Authority report shows that the country’s rice supply significantly increased since the law was enacted. Rice production increased from 17.51 million metric tons in 2020 to 18.64 million metric tons by 2022. The increase in supply highlights the law’s efficacy in improving rice availability in the country. By allowing rice imports while promoting market competition, the law not only addressed shortages but also helped to stabilize rice prices and provide food security for the Filipino people.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Another objective of the law is to help local farmers through the Rice Competitive Enhancement Fund (RCEF). The 10 Billion Pesos allocated budget per year plus any additional earnings from rice tariff collections, aims to help farmers, and farmworkers to enhance their competitiveness in the market. The RCEF attempts to boost farmers' productivity and incomes by supporting many sectors of rice cultivation, including as mechanization, seed development, and training programs. </p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) it appears that local farmers' profits have not increased significantly. Profits for local farmers appear to have remained relatively flat as poverty figures for 2021 reveals that farmers continue to confront significant challenges, with a 30.0% poverty rate making them the second poorest among 14 sectors. Furthermore, the comparison between 2018 and 2021 suggests a substantial tendency of growing poverty among farmers, implying that their revenues may not have improved or perhaps decreased.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, unconstrained importation might potentially boost competition for local producers, resulting in reduced pricing for their products; it is expected that this has contributed to the growth of poverty in the Philippines. If local farmers and producers are unable to compete with lower-cost imported items, their incomes may decline, leading to increasing poverty rates. The data above also shows that the poverty rate among farmers has increased significantly. Furthermore, rising rice prices have resulted in a 1.4% increase in poverty between 2018 and 2021. An upsurge in the value of rice has the ability to boost the poverty rate, particularly in the Philippines, where rice is a staple meal and a significant amount of household income is spent on food. When rice prices rise, households that rely heavily on rice for its nutritional value may struggle to get adequate food, leading to malnutrition.</p></div>

<header>
 <h2 style="text-align: left;">CONCLUSION</h2>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of RTL is to remove quantitative import constraints on rice with a free and competitive marketplace, therefore stabilizing rice prices and solving the scarce rice supply of the country. While the law initially stabilize rice prices, there is a significant increased in rice prices from 2021 until this the present day. The increase has been attributed to a number of factors, including the covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The law was also intended to help local rice growers through RCEF; nonetheless, records suggest that farmers' profits have not improve significantly and poverty rates among farmers have increased. Unconstraint imports could have caused this, as they may result in increased competition and lower prices for locally owned business. As a result, it can be asserted that, while the law increased rice output and availability, it did not solve poverty or economic imbalances among local farmers.</p></div>

<div class="a"><p style="text-align: justify;">The study on the effectiveness of RTL and its impact on poverty alleviation shows several problems. To solve these, concerns, several recommendations are proposed. First, government agencies should evaluate RTL’s execution to verify their effectiveness in assisting local farmers. This might involve providing more targeted support via RCEF and other programs to improve farmers’ competitiveness and revenue. Additionally, the government ought to enhance coordination amongst government agencies and participants in rice production and distribution. This will guarantee that RTL is properly enforced. Lastly, to address the high rice prices, the NFA could offer to sell rice at a lower price rather than purchasing exclusively domestically produced rice as a buffer stock. Selling rice at a lower price via NFA can help make rice less expensive to costumers, especially, during times of inflation. This strategy can also serve to stabilize the market by offering a cheaper alternative to rice supplied by individual sellers. Additionally, it can ensure that the NFA accomplishes its goal of providing food security and market price stability.</p></div>
